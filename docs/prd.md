# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Decentralized Webhook System

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
To design a decentralized system that incentivizes nodes to swiftly and accurately write transactions from our webhook pool to the blockchain.

### 1.2 Background
Centralized systems are vulnerable to single points of failure. By decentralizing our webhook system, we increase resilience and optimize transaction handling. Furthermore, by incentivizing nodes through a reward mechanism, we can ensure transaction accuracy and timeliness.

## 2. Objectives

- **Resilience**: Eliminate single points of failure by distributing transaction handling across multiple nodes.
- **Efficiency**: Decrease transaction processing time by incentivizing nodes.
- **Transparency**: Allow all stakeholders to verify transaction statuses and node rewards.

## 3. Stakeholders

- **Engineering**: To design, implement, and maintain the system.
- **Product**: To define the system's features, oversee its development, and ensure it meets user needs.
- **Marketing**: To communicate the system's benefits and features to potential users and stakeholders.

## 4. Features & Requirements

### 4.1 Decentralized Node System

- **Description**: Utilize libp2p to establish a decentralized network of nodes.
- **Requirements**:
  - Nodes should register and discover peers using Distributed Hash Table (DHT).
  - Nodes will stake "masa" tokens as a commitment to process transactions.

### 4.2 Transaction Processing

- **Description**: Nodes pick up transactions from the webhook pool and write them to the blockchain.
- **Requirements**:
  - Each transaction should be verified for authenticity.
  - Transactions should be processed in a timely manner.

### 4.3 Incentive Mechanism

- **Description**: Nodes are rewarded for writing transactions to the blockchain.
- **Requirements**:
  - Nodes that successfully write a transaction are rewarded with "masa" tokens from an Ethereum smart contract.
  - Malicious or non-performing nodes should be penalized by slashing their staked tokens.

### 4.4 Transparency & Monitoring

- **Description**: Implement a mechanism for stakeholders to verify transaction statuses and node rewards.
- **Requirements**:
  - All transactions should be traceable with a unique ID.
  - A public ledger should display rewards and penalties for each node.

## 5. User Flow

1. Nodes join the network, register their details, and stake "masa" tokens.
2. The webhook system pushes a transaction to the network.
3. Nodes compete to process and write the transaction to the blockchain.
4. Once a transaction is successfully written, the responsible node is rewarded.
5. Stakeholders can monitor and verify transaction statuses and node rewards through a transparent interface.

## 6. Marketing & Communication

- **Unique Selling Proposition (USP)**: A decentralized, transparent, and incentivized system for efficient transaction processing.
- **Target Audience**: Blockchain enthusiasts, tech companies interested in decentralized systems, and potential node operators.
- **Communication Channels**: Blog posts, webinars, social media, and tech conferences.

## 7. Milestones & Timeline

1. **System Design & Architecture**: 2 weeks
2. **Development & Testing**: 8 weeks
3. **Beta Launch**: 2 weeks
4. **Feedback & Iteration**: 4 weeks
5. **Official Launch**: Targeted in 4 months from project initiation.

## 8. Conclusion

This decentralized webhook system represents a fusion of technology and economics. By marrying the principles of decentralization with an incentive mechanism, we're poised to revolutionize how transactions are processed. Let's collaboratively usher in this new era of transaction handling.
