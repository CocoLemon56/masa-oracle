# Masa Oracle: Decentralized Data Protocol üåê

The Masa Oracle defines how private behavioral and identity data is accessed, shared, and rewarded in a decentralized and private way. The Masa Oracle guarantees transparency, security, and equitable compensation for nodes that particiapte in the Masa zk-Data Network & Marketplace.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before diving in, ensure these prerequisites are installed:
- **Go**: Grab it from [Go's official site](https://golang.org/dl/).
- **Docker**: Install from [Docker's official docs](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/masa-finance/masa-oracle.git
cd masa-oracle
```

2. Build the node executable:
```bash
go build -v -o masa-node ./cmd/masa-node
```

## Staking Tokens

üîê To participate in the network and earn rewards, you must first stake your tokens:
```bash
./masa-node --stake 100
```
This command initiates the staking process, allowing the staking contract to spend tokens on your behalf and then stakes the specified amount.

## Running the Node

üöÄ To start your node and join the Masa network:
```bash
./masa-node --start
```
This command will start the node using the list of bootnodes specified in the configuration file, if available.

## Command-Line Interface (CLI)

Customize your node's behavior with various flags:
```bash
./masa-node --bootnodes=node1,node2,node3 --port=8080 --udp=true --tcp=false
```
- `--bootnodes=node1,node2,node3`: Connect to specified bootnodes.
- `--port=8080`: Listen on port `8080`.
- `--udp=true`: Enable UDP protocol.
- `--tcp=false`: Disable TCP protocol.

Defaults are used if flags are not set:

- `bootnodes`: Falls back to `BOOTNODES` env variable or an empty string.
- `port`: Defaults to `portNbr` env variable or `0`.
- `udp`: Defaults to `UDP` env variable or `false`.
- `tcp`: Defaults to `TCP` env variable or `false`.

## Configuration

üîß To use a custom configuration file:

```bash
./masa-node --config=path/to/config.json
```

The configuration file is a JSON format that includes an array of bootnodes.

## Connecting Nodes

üîó To connect to a specific node in the network:
```bash
./masa-node --bootnodes=/ip4/34.133.16.77/udp/4001/quic-v1/p2p/16Uiu2HAmAEDCYv5RrbLhZRmHXGWXNuSFa7YDoC5BGeN3NtDmiZEb --port=4001 --udp=true --tcp=false
```
This will connect your Masa Oracle node to the specified node using the provided multi-address.

## Ad Network Proof of Concept

üì¢ Masa Oracle introduces a decentralized ad network as a proof of concept within the decentralized data protocol. This network allows publishers who are staked in the system to publish advertisements to a dedicated topic.

### How It Works

- Publishers must first stake tokens to participate in the ad network, ensuring a commitment to the network's integrity.
- Once staked, publishers can publish ads to the `ad-topic` using the `PublishAd` method in the `OracleNode`.
- Ads are structured with content and metadata, as defined in the `Ad` struct in `pkg/ad/ad.go`.
- Only staked nodes can publish to the ad topic, as enforced by the `PublishAd` method in `OracleNode`, which checks the `IsStaked` flag before allowing publication.

## Use Cases

The Masa Oracle ad network can be utilized in various scenarios, such as:

- **Targeted Advertising**: Leveraging the decentralized identity data to deliver personalized ads without compromising user privacy.
- **Content Monetization**: Content creators can receive compensation directly through the protocol for hosting ads.
- **Community Governance**: Staked nodes can vote on ad policies, ensuring that the network remains aligned with the community's values.

## Updates & Additional Information

üì¢ Stay tuned to the Masa Oracle repository for updates and more details on how to use the protocol effectively.
